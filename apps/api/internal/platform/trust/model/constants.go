// Scan status (trust_scan_result.status) — the AI shadow-scoring pipeline (step
// 03). pending is the fresh intake; the scoring worker drives it to scored (the
// gateway returned a verdict) or degraded (unconfigured / failed / the gateway's
// own fail-open).
//
// Only scored is terminal. degraded was ALSO terminal until 2026-08-07, on the
// reasoning that a queue which never re-claims can never back up — true, but it
// bought that guarantee by discarding content permanently. A transient upstream
// blip became an unjudged item forever, and because the drain was silent nobody
// learned it had happened. The bound now comes from maxScanAttempts instead: the
// queue still drains, but only after the work has actually been tried.
