// RegisterAll is the single list of editable catalog entity types. It exists

// for IdentityFollowStmts, so adding a type to one of them would have left every
// suppression on the other silently unfollowed by the next merge.
//
// cmd/rekey-edit-history is deliberately NOT a caller — it rekeys work history
// only and registers catalog.work alone.
